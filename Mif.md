# Using MongoDB
* So far: we have been using in memory storage, and we are moving to a real database
* MongoDB: stores JSON Documents -> which fits well with our web application as it uses JSON data 
* We will store all the array of objects in the `data.json` file in the database 
* Cluster0 -> our database store 

# Connecting to the database
