## Add New Post Feature.png 

The screenshot captures the user interface presented when clicking the 'Add New Post' button in the navigation bar. This page displays a form designed for the creation of a new post with the following fields: 

    - Post Title: Where users enter the title of their post.
    - Choose File: An option to upload any relevant image to accompany the post. 
    - Content: A large text area where the users can write the content of their post, providing details, questions, or information they wish to share.
    - Category Dropdown: Where users can select a topic to add this post to through a dropdown menu. 

## Home Page.png

The screenshot illustrates the home page users are greeted with upon logging into the ReedMi platform. It is designed to be the central hub where users can immerse themselves in the latest tech-related discussions and contributions from the community. Key elements of this page include:
    - Navigation Bar (Top): this is prominently placed at the top and includes the webapp logo 'ReedMi' to the left, 'TechNews' where users can view all the latest tech news and a 'Add New Post" button where users can go to create new content. 
    - Topics Panel (Left): A vertical panel listing various topics such as 'Hardware', 'Languages', 'Solutions', and others. Each topic acts as a filter to tailor the displayed posts to the user's interests. There is also a 'Create New Topic' option at the bottom of this panel, inviting users to expand the conversation with their own new categories.
    - Content Area (Center): This is the main area where individual posts are displayed. Each post includes the username of the poster (e.g., u/calum), the title of the post (e.g., 'Best gaming rig'), and a brief content snippet or image if attached. It is the interactive segment where users can click on a post to delve into the details, engage with content through comments, and participate in discussions.

Additionally, it displays a tally of the accumulated likes and dislikes, giving a snapshot of the community's reception to the post. Below the reactions, users can browse through existing replies to the post, offering a window into the community's dialogue. To further engage with the conversation, users have the option to add their comments, contributing their perspectives to the ongoing discussion.
