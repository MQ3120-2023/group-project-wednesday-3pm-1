## Project Description 

Our project ReedMi is a user-focused discussion platform similar to Reddit that aims to create a network for 'geeky' users to talk and gain knowledge about tech-related topics. ReedMi will help create this network by offering a forum for tech enthusiasts to propose topics and publish content. All users can access these various postings and participate by leaving comments likes or dislikes. Users can search for topics using the side panel filter, which will lead them to thier favorite posts. Users can create new posts using the Navigation bar to add to the forum. Users can fetch news from a third party API through 'Tech News'.

ReedMi uses MongoDB, a server that retrieves and transfesr data to and from a database that houses user-generated content.
ReedMi uses Google authentication
